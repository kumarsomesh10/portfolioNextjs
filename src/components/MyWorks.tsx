      "Analyzed NSL-KDD and CAN BUS datasets and explored various baseline models, ultimately determining that implementing Random Forest with PCA gives maximum 99.8% accuracy. Introduced diverse types of Noises and applied multiple scaling techniques to test the robustness of the models. Concluded that while Random Forest with PCA is adept for swift response, Gradient Boosting for 99.0054% accuracy and XGBoost for 99.6896% accuracy demonstrated greater robustness.",
